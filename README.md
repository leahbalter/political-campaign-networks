# political-campaign-networks
Continuation of our study of utilizing political campaign contribution networks to study federal election races. 

Things we want to do:
  1. Apply the same code for 2008-2010 to 2012-2016 (and eventually 2018 once the cycle has finished)
  2. Investigate House, presidential, and primary races
  3. see if we can utilize these techniques to study gerrymandering in a given state over a period of time

data is from: https://classic.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml, utilizing the following two files for each election cycle:
  1. Any Transaction from One Committee to Another - we call 'transXXXX.txt', where XXXX is the year
  2. Candidate Master File	- we call this 'cnXXXX.txt', where XXXX is the year
