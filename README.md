# political-campaign-networks
Studying political campaign contributions utilizing network science

We want to:
  1. Run the same code on the years 2012-2016 too (and eventually 2018 once the elections are over)
  2. Study House, presidential, and primary races
  3. See if we can utilize this technique to study gerrymandering
